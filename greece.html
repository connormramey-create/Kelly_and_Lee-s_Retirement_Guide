<h4>Greece</h4>

<p>INNNNFFFOOOOO DUMPPPPPPPP!</p>
<div></div>
<p>The capitol is Athens, full of history and ancient architecture. Greece's main exports include petroleum and pharmaceuticals, which suprised me for sure. The currency in Greece is the Euro so you can just keep it from another trip to use here. The primary language spoken in Greece is Modern Greek which is spoken by the vast majority of the people living there.</p>

<p>Greece is one of the best countries to visit in the summer visit the Acropolis in Athens, Knossos Palace in Crete, and ruins in the Peloponnese just to name a few!</p>
